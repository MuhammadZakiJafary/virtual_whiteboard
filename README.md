# virtual_whiteboard
This project demonstrates how computer vision can be used to create a virtual writing and drawing system controlled entirely by hand gestures. Using OpenCV (CV2), the program detects the movement of a user’s hand through a live webcam feed and converts those gestures into digital ink on the screen.
